The T-statistic value is -1.5303, and the corresponding P-value is 0.1645. This suggests that there is no significant difference in grip strength between individuals with and without frailty symptoms at a significance level of 0.05.
Correlation Analysis:

The correlation coefficient between grip strength and frailty is -0.4759. This negative correlation indicates that there is a moderate inverse relationship between grip strength and frailty; as grip strength decreases, frailty tends to increase.

There is roughly a 0.193 connection relationship between frailty and height.

This positive association implies that frailty and height have a weakly positive relationship. It's important to remember that the correlation coefficient is low, showing that there isn't a strong link between frailty and height.

A correlation coefficient of 0.5352 suggests that there is a tendency for weight to increase as frailty increases, and vice versa

correlation between age and frailty is weakly negative, indicating a slight tendency for frailty to decrease as age increases, or vice versa
