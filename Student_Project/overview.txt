Different kinds of insights have been facilitated by each of the analysis's visualizations:

Math Scores by Gender in a Box Plot: It is simpler to examine the distribution of arithmetic scores between male and female students, spot outliers, and observe variations in median performance with this display.

Average Reading Scores by Parental Education Level in a Bar Chart: This facilitates the analysis of the effects of varying parental education levels on pupils' reading scores and the identification of patterns or discrepancies.

The violin plot, which displays variations more effectively than a box plot, aids in understanding the distribution and density of math scores for each parental education level.

It is simpler to see the proportions and variations in lunch status (such as free/reduced or standard meal) across various parental education levels when the lunch status distribution by parental education level is displayed in a pie chart.

 Swarm Plot-Math Score by Gender and Test Preparation Course: This provides a thorough analysis of individual data points, highlighting clustering patterns and demonstrating the effects of gender and test preparation on math results.

 Every visualization improves a certain feature of the data, which facilitates the identification of comparisons, trends, and distributions.
